          <strong>How can I learn how to ski?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>We welcome all levels of skiers to join our club. If you are a complete beginner then we run lessons, in blocks of three weeks, during the ski season that you are welcome to attend once you have joined the club. Check the club sessions page for details of the next start date. You may want to arrive 10-15 minutes early to get your skis and boots sorted out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="well">
          <strong>What do I need to wear?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>You need to wear gloves and long socks (if you haven’t got ski socks then a pair of football socks will do in the short term). Also your arms need to be covered. We provide lessons in all weather so be prepared to be out in the cold and wet!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
      <div class="well">
         <strong>How early do I need to arrive?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>Please arrive at least 15 minutes before your lesson time. This gives you plenty of time to get your skis and boots sorted out, and discuss any issues you may have with the instructors.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="well">
          <strong>Why do you need to know my weight?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>We need your weight so that the ski bindings can be set correctly. We do have scales at the club but it will save time if you have this information readily available.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

      <div class="container">
      <div class="well">
          <strong>How much does it cost?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>The cost is £5.00 per session. We offer a discount if you use your own equipment and only charge £2.00
        Annual membership is also required and you can join the first time you ski at the club – see the club sessions page for more details</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="well">
          <strong>Do you provide skis and boots for hire?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>Yes, we have a full range of carver skis and boots for use, which is included in the price.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
      <div class="container">
      <div class="well">
          <strong>Can I ski with my kids?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>We provide family ski sessions, about once a month during the Sunday evening session. All skiers must be able to turn and stop safely to ski during these sessions. The dates are advertised in the ski hut on the notice board.
        However there will be no instruction during these sessions.</p>

      <div class="container">
      <div class="well">
          <strong>Can I get more involved in the club?</strong>

        </div>
        <p>Yes – We are always on the look out for volunteers to help behind the desk, for social activites and to become ski instructors. Full training on binding fitting will be provided to all helpers and training will be given to become qualified as an instructor. We also race an we organize teams for the Summer Race League at Stoke, for all age categories, and during the winter at Pendle, for juniors and Sheffield for all age categories. This provides a great way to improve you skiing skills and have lots of fun. See our racing page for more details</p>
